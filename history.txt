History:
2013-12-11, tw - Version 0.0.1

Decided to completely discard the 2012 version of this tool. Want to make it 
open source and the last version made use of several commercial frameworks.
So just started from scratch with a basic MVC4 application and will be hosting
this on github / windows azure.

This version is basically an unmodified MVC template project with automaic 
entity framework database migrations enabled.

I will head for the most straightforward and simple approach in terms of
architecture - so no multi-tier cloud app at this point.

First goal is to get this thing usable again with very limited time.
